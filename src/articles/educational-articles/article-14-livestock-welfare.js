    <h2>Sustainable Livestock Management for Productivity and Welfare</h2>
    <p>Sustainable livestock management ensures that animals are raised humanely while maintaining economic productivity. This is not an either-or choice—it's both.</p>
    
    <h3>Expert Insights from Dr. Racho and Dr. Alkuino</h3>
    <p>These veterinarians share their experience in helping farms transition to welfare-focused management practices.</p>
    
    <h3>Core Principles of Sustainable Livestock Management</h3>
    <h4>Natural Behavior Expression</h4>
    <p>Animals should be able to express natural behaviors such as grazing, foraging, and socializing. This improves both welfare and productivity.</p>
    
    <h4>Health and Disease Prevention</h4>
    <p>Prevention through proper housing, nutrition, and management reduces disease and the need for antibiotics.</p>
    
    <h4>Environmental Stewardship</h4>
    <p>Sustainable practices minimize environmental impact through rotational grazing, soil conservation, reduced chemical inputs, and waste management systems.</p>
    
    <h3>The Economics of Animal Welfare</h3>
    <p>Research consistently shows that welfare-focused farming is profitable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Healthier animals require less medical treatment</li>
      <li>Better nutrition improves productivity</li>
      <li>Reduced stress improves reproduction rates</li>
      <li>Consumers increasingly prefer responsibly-raised products</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Practical Implementations</h3>
    <h4>Pasture-Based Systems</h4>
    <p>Allowing animals to graze on pasture improves their health, reduces disease, and produces higher-quality products.</p>
    
    <h4>Herd Management</h4>
    <p>Proper stocking densities and grouping strategies reduce stress and aggression among animals.</p>
    
    <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Sustainable livestock management proves that animal welfare and economic viability are not competing interests—they're complementary goals.
