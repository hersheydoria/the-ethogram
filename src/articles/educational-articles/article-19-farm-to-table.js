    <h2>From Farm to Table: One Health Considerations</h2>
    <p>The journey of food from farm to consumer involves multiple touchpoints where animal welfare, food safety, and human health intersect.</p>
    
    <h3>Understanding One Health</h3>
    <p>One Health is an integrated approach recognizing that human health, animal health, and environmental health are interconnected.</p>
    
    <h3>Current Status in Bukidnon</h3>
    <h4>Slaughterhouse Standards</h4>
    <p>Many slaughterhouses are working to meet national and international standards for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Humane animal handling and slaughter</li>
      <li>Sanitation and hygiene practices</li>
      <li>Waste management</li>
      <li>Disease surveillance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Wet Market Conditions</h4>
    <p>Wet markets present unique challenges for maintaining food safety and animal welfare standards while preserving traditional commerce.</p>
    
    <h3>Key One Health Standards</h3>
    <h4>Animal Welfare</h4>
    <p>Humane treatment of animals before slaughter reduces stress-related meat quality issues and improves worker safety.</p>
    
    <h4>Food Safety</h4>
    <p>Proper slaughter techniques and sanitation prevent contamination and foodborne illness.</p>
    
    <h4>Disease Prevention</h4>
    <p>Surveillance for zoonotic diseases protects both animals and human consumers.</p>
    
    <h3>Improving Compliance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Training for slaughterhouse workers and wet market vendors</li>
      <li>Infrastructure improvements for sanitation</li>
      <li>Regular inspections and monitoring</li>
      <li>Community education on food safety</li>
    </ul>
