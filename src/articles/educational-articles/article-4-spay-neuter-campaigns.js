    <h2>Why Spay and Neuter Programs Matter</h2>
    <p>Spaying and neutering are among the most important interventions in animal welfare. These procedures have significant benefits for individual animals and populations alike.</p>
    
    <h3>Population Control</h3>
    <p>The statistics are staggering: millions of unwanted animals end up in shelters each year. Spay and neuter programs are the most effective way to prevent overpopulation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One unspayed female dog can produce 2 litters per year with 6-10 puppies each</li>
      <li>Within 7 years, that one dog could result in over 4,000 descendants</li>
      <li>Spaying or neutering prevents this exponential growth</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
    <h4>For Female Animals</h4>
    <p>Spaying eliminates the risk of uterine infections (pyometra) and significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer, especially when performed before the first heat cycle.</p>
    
    <h4>For Male Animals</h4>
    <p>Neutering prevents testicular cancer and reduces the risk of prostate problems. It also reduces aggressive behavior and roaming tendencies.</p>
    
    <h3>Community Impact in Bukidnon</h3>
    <p>Spay/neuter programs in Bukidnon have shown tremendous success in reducing stray populations and improving community animal welfare.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Spaying and neutering is not just about pet population control—it's about preventing suffering, improving individual animal health, and creating more humane communities.
