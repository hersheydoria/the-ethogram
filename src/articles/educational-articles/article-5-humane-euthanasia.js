    <h2>The Ethics of Humane Euthanasia</h2>
    <p>One of the most challenging aspects of veterinary medicine is providing humane euthanasia when an animal's quality of life can no longer be maintained. This decision requires careful ethical consideration.</p>
    
    <h3>Understanding Quality of Life</h3>
    <p>The primary factor in euthanasia decisions is an animal's quality of life. Veterinarians use the HHHHHMM scale to evaluate this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>H</strong>urt - Is pain present?</li>
      <li><strong>H</strong>ungry - Can the animal eat adequately?</li>
      <li><strong>H</strong>ydration - Can the animal drink adequately?</li>
      <li><strong>H</strong>ygiene - Can the animal keep itself clean?</li>
      <li><strong>H</strong>appiness - Can the animal engage in activities it enjoys?</li>
      <li><strong>H</strong>ope - Is there a reasonable chance of improvement?</li>
      <li><strong>M</strong>obility - Can the animal move adequately?</li>
      <li><strong>M</strong>ore good days than bad - Overall quality assessment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Euthanasia Process</h3>
    <p>Humane euthanasia typically involves a two-step process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sedation or anesthesia to ensure the animal feels no pain</li>
      <li>Administration of an overdose of anesthetic agent to stop vital functions</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Ethical Principles</h3>
    <h4>Autonomy and Decision-Making</h4>
    <p>Pet owners must make informed decisions about their animal's care. Veterinarians have an ethical obligation to provide honest, compassionate communication about prognosis and options.</p>
    
    <h4>Preventing Suffering</h4>
    <p>The primary ethical principle is to prevent unnecessary suffering. When treatment is no longer beneficial, euthanasia can be the most humane option.</p>
    
    <h3>Supporting Pet Owners</h3>
    <p>Many veterinary clinics now offer grief counseling and memorial services to help pet owners process their loss. This support is an important part of compassionate veterinary care.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Euthanasia, when performed with compassion and ethical consideration, is an act of kindness that prevents suffering.
