    <h2>The Problems with Dog Tethering</h2>
    <p>Tethering dogs—tying them to a fixed object—is a common practice that has serious welfare implications. Understanding these issues helps us promote better alternatives.</p>
    
    <h3>Welfare Issues Associated with Tethering</h3>
    <h4>Physical Health Problems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Injuries from entanglement</li>
      <li>Neck and tracheal damage from collar pressure</li>
      <li>Inability to access shelter, food, or water</li>
      <li>Overheating or hypothermia</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Behavioral and Psychological Issues</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Frustration and aggression due to inability to move</li>
      <li>Anxiety and fear</li>
      <li>Lack of mental stimulation</li>
      <li>Increased risk of escaping or developing behavioral problems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Socialization Problems</h3>
    <p>Tethered dogs have limited social interaction with humans and other dogs, leading to poor socialization and increased aggression.</p>
    
    <h3>Humane Alternatives</h3>
    <h4>Secure Fencing</h4>
    <p>Well-maintained fencing allows dogs to exercise and play safely within a defined area.</p>
    
    <h4>Dog Runs and Kennels</h4>
    <p>Properly designed enclosures provide space to move while remaining secure.</p>
    
    <h4>Regular Exercise and Supervision</h4>
    <p>Walking, playtime, and supervised outdoor time meet dogs' physical and social needs.</p>
    
    <h3>Community Education</h3>
    <p>Many communities are implementing laws limiting or banning tethering. Public education campaigns help people understand the welfare implications and adopt better practices.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      Breaking the chain means advocating for dogs' fundamental right to move, play, and interact in ways that support their physical and psychological well-being.
