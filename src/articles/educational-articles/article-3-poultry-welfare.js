    <h2>Ethical Poultry Farming in the Philippines</h2>

    <h3>Core Principles of Poultry Welfare</h3>

    <p>Providing adequate space allows birds to express natural behaviors including perching, dust bathing, and foraging.</p>
    
    <h4>Nutrition and Water</h4>
    <p>Quality feed formulated for different life stages and constant access to clean water are fundamental to poultry health.</p>
    
    <h4>Disease Prevention</h4>
    <p>Good hygiene practices, vaccination programs, and biosecurity measures prevent disease outbreaks.</p>
    
    <h3>Philippine-Specific Considerations</h3>
    <h4>Climate Adaptation</h4>
    <p>Philippine poultry farms must address tropical climate challenges including high humidity and heat stress.</p>
    
    <h4>Local Practices</h4>
    <p>Integrating traditional knowledge with modern welfare standards creates practical, sustainable systems.</p>
