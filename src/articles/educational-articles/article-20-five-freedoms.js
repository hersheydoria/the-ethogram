    <h2>The Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare</h2>
    <p>The Five Freedoms provide a framework for understanding and ensuring good animal welfare in all situations, especially during times of crisis.</p>
    
    <h3>The Five Freedoms</h3>
    <h4>1. Freedom from Hunger and Thirst</h4>
    <p>Animals must have access to fresh water and a diet appropriate for their species and life stage.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Freedom from Discomfort</h4>
    <p>Animals must have a suitable environment including shelter, space, and appropriate bedding.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Freedom from Pain, Injury, or Disease</h4>
    <p>Animals must receive preventive care and prompt treatment for any health issues.</p>
    
    <h4>4. Freedom to Express Normal Behavior</h4>
    <p>Animals must have space and opportunity to express their natural behaviors.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Freedom from Fear and Distress</h4>
    <p>Animals must be protected from conditions causing fear, anxiety, or suffering.</p>
    
    <h3>Special Importance During Disasters</h3>
    <h4>Challenges During Emergencies</h4>
    <p>Disasters—floods, earthquakes, fires—create situations where maintaining these freedoms becomes difficult but more critical than ever.</p>
    
    <h4>Evacuation Planning</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare carriers and crates for safe transport</li>
      <li>Keep vaccination records and identification accessible</li>
      <li>Identify pet-friendly shelters and facilities</li>
      <li>Stock emergency supplies (food, water, medications)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Community Response</h4>
    <p>Communities should have disaster plans that include provisions for animal welfare and rescue.</p>
    
    <h3>Applying the Freedoms</h3>
    <h4>In Shelters During Disasters</h4>
    <p>Emergency shelters must ensure animals maintain access to food, water, suitable conditions, and care even in temporary situations.</p>
    
    <h4>In Recovery Efforts</h4>
    <p>Post-disaster recovery should prioritize reuniting animals with owners and addressing long-term welfare needs.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      The Five Freedoms are not luxuries—they are fundamental rights that ensure animals can live with dignity, especially when disaster strikes.
