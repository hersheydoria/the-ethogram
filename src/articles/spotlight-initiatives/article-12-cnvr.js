    <h2>Beyond the Pound: Community-Centered Animal Welfare</h2>
    <p>Traditional animal control focused on impounding animals. Modern communities are shifting toward Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) and community-based programs that are more humane and effective.</p>
    
    <h3>Case Study: Cebu City</h3>
    <p>Cebu City has pioneered CNVR (Community-based Neuter/Vaccination/Return) programs that have significantly reduced stray populations.</p>
    
    <h4>Results After 3 Years</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced stray population by 60%</li>
      <li>Decreased euthanasia rates by 85%</li>
      <li>Improved community relationships with animals</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Case Study: Agusan del Norte</h3>
    <p>Agusan del Norte adapted Cebu's model to fit local conditions, achieving similar success in rural settings.</p>
    
    <h3>Understanding TNR/CNVR</h3>
    <p>Community-based Neuter/Vaccination/Return (CNVR) programs involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trapping community animals humanely</li>
      <li>Providing veterinary care (spay/neuter and vaccination)</li>
      <li>Returning animals to their communities with caretakers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why CNVR is More Effective</h3>
    <h4>Population Control Without Killing</h4>
    <p>Unlike impoundment and euthanasia, CNVR humanely controls population while preserving animal life and community relationships.</p>
    
    <h4>Disease Prevention</h4>
    <p>Vaccination against rabies and other diseases occurs during the procedure, protecting both animals and the community.</p>
    
    <h4>Cost-Effectiveness</h4>
    <p>CNVR programs cost less than traditional animal control while achieving better outcomes.</p>
    
    <h3>Building Support for CNVR</h3>
    <p>Community education is essential. When residents understand the benefits of CNVR, they become advocates for the program.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      CNVR represents a fundamental shift in how communities can care for animals—moving from control and elimination to compassion and stewardship.
