    <h2>Understanding Government Investment in Animal Welfare</h2>
    <p>Animal welfare funding in the Philippines comes from various government sources, but many communities question whether adequate resources are allocated to animal protection.</p>
    
    <h3>Current Funding Landscape</h3>
    <h4>Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI)</h4>
    <p>The BAI oversees livestock health, veterinary services, and animal welfare programs. However, funding has remained relatively stagnant.</p>
    
    <h4>Local Government Units (LGUs)</h4>
    <p>Many LGUs allocate resources to animal control and welfare, but spending varies widely by municipality.</p>
    
    <h3>Where Tax Money Goes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Animal shelters and control facilities</li>
      <li>Veterinary services and vaccination programs</li>
      <li>Wildlife conservation and protection</li>
      <li>Disaster response for animals</li>
      <li>Disease surveillance and quarantine</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Gaps in Current Funding</h3>
    <h4>Insufficient Coverage</h4>
    <p>Many communities lack adequate animal shelters, vaccination programs, and emergency response services.</p>
    
    <h4>Rural-Urban Disparities</h4>
    <p>Urban areas often receive more funding, leaving rural communities with limited animal welfare services.</p>
    
    <h4>Wildlife Protection</h4>
    <p>Endangered species protection, including the Philippine Eagle, receives limited funding relative to conservation needs.</p>
    
    <h3>Policy Advocacy</h3>
    <h4>Proposed Legislative Changes</h4>
    <p>Animal welfare advocates propose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased budget allocation for BAI and LGU animal services</li>
      <li>Mandated spay/neuter programs in municipalities</li>
      <li>Stricter animal abuse penalties and enforcement</li>
      <li>Wildlife conservation funding mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Making a Difference</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Every peso invested in animal welfare creates healthier communities, prevents disease, and reflects our values as a society.
    </blockquote>
