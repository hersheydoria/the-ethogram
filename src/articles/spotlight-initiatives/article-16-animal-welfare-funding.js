    <p>Animal cruelty is not always loud, dramatic, or obvious. Sometimes, it hides in daily routines, cultural traditions, or silent backyards—often unrecognized as a violation of law or, worse, tolerated as <i>"normal."</i> Yet across the <b>Philippines</b>, from northern highlands to dense urban centers, communities are beginning to confront the harsh realities faced by animals and the moral responsibility every citizen carries. The question that now demands attention is simple but urgent: Are we doing enough?</p>

    <h2>A Growing Problem in Baguio City</h2>
    <p><b>Baguio City</b>, known for its cool climate and vibrant culture, has recently found itself confronting an unsettling trend. The <b>Baguio City Police Office (BCPO)</b> recorded five cases of animal cruelty this year, up from three cases reported during the same period last year. Disturbingly, many of these cases involve the serving of dog meat as pulutan, a practice that persists despite being explicitly prohibited under the <b>Animal Welfare Act of 1998 (RA 8485)</b>, as amended by <b>RA 10631</b>.</p>
    <p><b>BCPO City Director, PCOL Francisco B. Bulwayan, Jr.,</b> emphasized the gravity of the issue: <i>"The protection of animals is a shared responsibility, and we urge the public to respect and abide by the legal prohibitions."</i></p>
    <p>The city's concern intensified following a series of incidents in 2024. In June, <b>Mayor Benjamin Magalong</b> ordered the inspection of local eateries after reports of dog meat being served. This followed charges filed against a man caught butchering a dog in <b>Barangay Irisan</b> in May. By September, the butchering of at least three dogs in <b>La Trinidad</b> had been caught on camera, igniting public outrage and renewed calls for action.</p>
    <p>These incidents reflect a deeper societal dilemma: Where does animal welfare stand in our list of priorities? Despite long-standing legislation, cases of cruelty continue to slip through the cracks, overshadowed by broader socio-economic challenges. This begs the question: Is the law alone enough to end animal cruelty?</p>

    <h2>Understanding What Counts as Cruelty</h2>
    <p>Understanding what truly counts as cruelty is the first step in recognizing it and speaking up. The <b>Animal Welfare Act (RA 8485 as amended)</b> protects all animals—pets, farm animals, working animals, wildlife, and those used for entertainment or research. It prohibits physical abuse, beating, and torture; neglect and abandonment; killing without authority or humane reason; illegal trade such as dog meat trafficking and wildlife smuggling; animal fighting; unauthorized experimentation; and irresponsible breeding that harms animal health. But cruelty is not limited to these clear-cut offenses. It can be as heartbreaking as a starving dog tied with a short rope outside a home, a carabao forced to plow fields despite an open wound, or a caged bird left without food and shade on a scorching balcony. These everyday scenes often go unnoticed—but they are acts of suffering just the same.</p>
    <p>What is happening in <b>Baguio</b> is not an isolated problem. Cities across the <b>Philippines</b> face the same struggles. In <b>Cebu City</b>, pets are often abandoned when owners relocate, and stray dogs are sometimes poisoned in residential areas. <b>Manila</b> continues to battle a thriving illegal wildlife trade, where exotic birds and reptiles are sold in secret markets. In <b>Davao City</b>, maltreated horses used for tourism have pushed local leaders to strengthen animal welfare ordinances. Even in <b>General Santos City</b>, cases of livestock neglect remain common, often rooted in poor animal management.</p>

    <h2>Strengthening Animal Protection: Programs, People, and Practices</h2>
    <p>In response to rising concerns, <b>Baguio City</b> has strengthened its animal protection programs, combining government mandates with community participation. Beyond the city pound, the local government conducts annual rabies vaccination drives, serving over 5,000 dogs and cats, and implements neutering initiatives that help curb stray populations—an approach supported by studies showing significant reductions in abandonment.</p>
    <p>Local NGOs such as <b>PAWS</b> and <b>Baguio Animal Welfare Advocates (BAWA)</b> play a vital role. Volunteers manage feeding stations, coordinate rescue missions, run social media awareness campaigns, and help rehome animals—facilitating over 200 adoptions yearly.</p>
    <p>Residents also participate actively by reporting cruelty through dedicated hotlines, reinforcing a culture of vigilance and compassion. Meanwhile, the city applies a catch-neuter-release (CNR) strategy for non-aggressive strays, minimizing euthanasia and aligning with global humane standards.</p>
    <p>These combined efforts are supported by <b>Ordinance 19-2021</b>, which requires dog owners to register, vaccinate, microchip, and properly leash their pets—recognizing that responsible pet ownership is essential in preventing animal suffering.</p>

    <h2>Baguio's New Animal Care and Adoption Center: A Step Toward Humane Progress</h2>
    <p>A significant milestone in <b>Baguio's</b> animal welfare journey is the construction of a <b>PHP 10-million Animal Care and Adoption Center</b>, set to replace the city's cramped and overburdened pound. This two-story facility will provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Individual cages to prevent overcrowding</li>
      <li>A surgery room for medical treatments, neutering, and emergencies</li>
      <li>Offices for the <b>Animal Health Division</b></li>
      <li>A convenient on-site cashier's office for adoption and claiming fees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to <b>Dr. Silardo Bested</b> of the <b>City Veterinary and Agriculture Office (CVAO)</b>, the project reflects <b>Baguio's</b> growing commitment to humane, responsible animal care—a sentiment echoed by residents who call the initiative a <i>"dream come true"</i> for the city's voiceless animals.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>The new center is more than a modern facility. It represents a cultural shift toward empathy. For years, stray animals survived in cramped, overlooked spaces. By investing in humane infrastructure and education, <b>Baguio</b> sends a powerful message: Animals matter. Their welfare is part of a healthy community.</p>
    <p>Animal welfare is not just a policy issue—it is a reflection of our values. The silent suffering of animals across the <b>Philippines</b> challenges us to look beyond our routines and traditions and confront uncomfortable truths. Laws and facilities are vital, but real change requires compassion in action: responsible ownership, community participation, and the courage to speak up.</p>
    <p><b>Baguio's</b> progress shows what is possible when a city chooses empathy over apathy. The rest of the nation can—and should—do the same. Because ultimately, how we treat animals says everything about who we are.</p>
