    <h2>Saving the Philippine Eagle: A Conservation Story</h2>
    <p>The Philippine Eagle, one of the world's rarest and most powerful birds, stands on the brink of extinction. The Philippine Eagle Foundation works tirelessly to save this national bird.</p>
    
    <h3>The Plight of the Philippine Eagle</h3>
    <h4>Extinction Risk</h4>
    <p>With fewer than 400 breeding pairs left in the wild, the Philippine Eagle is critically endangered. It has lost approximately 99.5% of its original population.</p>
    
    <h4>Main Threats</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Deforestation has destroyed over 90% of the old-growth forest where eagles nest</li>
      <li><strong>Shooting:</strong> Despite legal protection, eagles are illegally killed</li>
      <li><strong>Electrocution:</strong> Power lines cause fatal accidents</li>
      <li><strong>Pesticide Poisoning:</strong> Bioaccumulation of chemicals in their food chain</li>
      <li><strong>Low Reproduction Rate:</strong> Eagles produce only one chick every two years</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Philippine Eagle Foundation's Work</h3>
    <h4>Research and Monitoring</h4>
    <p>Scientists track wild eagle populations, study nesting behavior, and identify key habitat areas for protection.</p>
    
    <h4>Habitat Protection</h4>
    <p>The foundation works with communities and government to protect old-growth forests where eagles breed and hunt.</p>
    
    <h4>Community Engagement</h4>
    <p>Education programs teach local communities about the ecological importance of eagles and the need for protection. Alternative livelihoods programs reduce pressure on forests.</p>
    
    <h4>Captive Breeding Program</h4>
    <p>While not a long-term solution, the foundation's breeding center helps maintain genetic diversity and serves educational purposes.</p>
    
    <h3>Success Stories</h3>
    <h4>Population Stabilization</h4>
    <p>In protected areas where forests remain intact and communities are engaged, eagle populations have stabilized and even increased slightly.</p>
    
    <h4>International Recognition</h4>
    <p>The foundation's work has garnered international support and funding, creating partnerships for conservation.</p>
    
    <h3>Hope for the Future</h3>
    <p>While challenges remain, the Philippine Eagle Foundation's work offers hope. Key factors for continued success include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Continued habitat protection and restoration</li>
      <li>Increased community involvement in conservation</li>
      <li>Stronger enforcement of protection laws</li>
      <li>Sustainable funding for long-term programs</li>
      <li>International cooperation and support</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Support the Philippine Eagle Foundation through donations</li>
