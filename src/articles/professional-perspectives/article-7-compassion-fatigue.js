    <h2>The Hidden Struggle of Veterinary Professionals</h2>
    <p>Veterinary medicine is a noble profession, but it comes with significant emotional challenges. Compassion fatigue—the emotional exhaustion that results from caring for suffering animals—affects many practitioners.</p>
    
    <h3>What is Compassion Fatigue?</h3>
    <p>Compassion fatigue is a state of physical and emotional exhaustion that develops as a result of prolonged exposure to emotionally demanding situations. Common symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional numbness</li>
      <li>Reduced empathy</li>
      <li>Loss of motivation</li>
      <li>Sleep disturbances</li>
      <li>Physical symptoms like headaches and body pain</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Stressors in Veterinary Practice</h3>
    <h4>Emotional Burden</h4>
    <p>Daily exposure to animal suffering, performing euthanasia, and delivering bad news to pet owners creates significant emotional stress.</p>
    
    <h4>High Pressure and Long Hours</h4>
    <p>Emergency veterinary work involves high-stakes decisions, long shifts, and physical exhaustion that compounds emotional stress.</p>
    
    <h4>Financial Stress</h4>
    <p>Many veterinarians face student debt and financial pressures that add to their overall stress levels.</p>
    
    <h3>Building Emotional Resilience</h3>
    <h4>Healthy Coping Mechanisms</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular exercise and physical activity</li>
      <li>Mindfulness and meditation practices</li>
      <li>Maintaining work-life balance</li>
      <li>Pursuing hobbies and interests outside of work</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Professional Support</h4>
    <p>Many veterinary organizations now recognize the importance of mental health support, offering counseling services, peer support groups, and wellness programs.</p>
    
    <h3>Workplace Changes</h3>
    <p>Progressive clinics are implementing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flexible scheduling to prevent burnout</li>
      <li>Team debriefings after difficult cases</li>
      <li>Mental health resources and referrals</li>
      <li>Professional development opportunities</li>
    </ul>
