    <h2>Caring for Mindanaonan Snakes in the Zoo Setting</h2>
    <p>Reptile care, particularly for endemic species like Mindanaonan snakes, requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to welfare standards.</p>
    
    <h3>Interview with Dr. Maria Santos, Zoo Veterinarian</h3>
    
    <h4>Q: What are the main welfare concerns for snakes in captive settings?</h4>
    <p><strong>Dr. Santos:</strong> "Temperature regulation is critical. Many keepers don't realize that snakes need precise temperature gradients to digest food properly and maintain their immune systems. Improper heating can lead to serious health issues."</p>
    
    <h3>Unique Challenges with Mindanaonan Species</h3>
    <h4>Limited Knowledge Base</h4>
    <p>Many Mindanaonan snake species have limited information available about their natural behavior and requirements, making husbandry challenging.</p>
    
    <h4>Stress Management</h4>
    <p>Snakes are sensitive to handling and environmental changes. Minimizing stress through proper enclosure design and handling protocols is essential.</p>
    
    <h4>Nutrition</h4>
    <p>Different species have different dietary needs. Some prefer live prey, while others adapt to pre-killed food, which is more humane.</p>
    
    <h3>Best Practices in Zoo Settings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Naturalistic enclosure design mimicking native habitats</li>
      <li>Proper humidity and temperature control</li>
      <li>Enrichment activities to promote natural behaviors</li>
      <li>Regular health monitoring and veterinary care</li>
      <li>Staff training on snake behavior and handling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Conservation Implications</h3>
    <blockquote>
      By caring for snakes well in captive settings, we learn valuable lessons that help us protect wild populations and their habitats.
