    <p>Near the edges of <b>Central Mindanao University (CMU)</b>, where the fields stretch into soft green shadows, something stirs long before students notice. A shift of leaves. A curve of movement. A presence that sends some running and others recording. What sparks panic for students is, for wildlife experts, a reminder that <b>CMU</b> sits within one of <b>Bukidnon's</b> last functioning natural corridors.</p>

    <h2>Meeting Jan Vincent Tevar</h2>

    <p><b>Jan Vincent A. Tevar</b> is a sixth-year Veterinary Medicine student and the president of <b>WILD</b>—the <b>Wildlife Initiative Leadership and Development</b> organization on campus. He speaks about snakes not with fear but with the practiced ease of someone who has spent years rescuing, observing, and living alongside them.</p>

    <p><i>"My passion has always centered on wildlife, especially exotic species. When I was younger, I joined mall shows and pet expos. I learned how to communicate with the public, how to turn fear into curiosity, and how to build appreciation for misunderstood species."</i></p>

    <p>Now, he leads an organization built on that very mission.</p>

    <h2>A New Org With an Old Responsibility</h2>

    <p><b>WILD</b> is young. The group was officially established only this semester, but its work had begun long before its paperwork. For years, <b>Tevar</b> responded to wildlife calls on his own, handling rescues with whatever knowledge and tools he had.</p>

    <p><i>"WILD operates based on the 4Rs. Recognize, Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Reconnect. These guide every action we take, from identification to safe handling and post-recovery release."</i></p>

    <p>Despite being new, the group has already rescued snakes, birds, and other wildlife across campus, and they conduct regular awareness seminars. Their goal is expansion: training communities—not just <b>CMU</b> students—in responsible coexistence.</p>

    <h2>A Rescue That Stayed With Him</h2>

    <p>Among the many cases <b>Tevar</b> has handled, one remains unforgettable.</p>

    <p>A <b>Samar cobra</b> had slipped into the <b>ADDL building</b>. Students panicked. The hallway filled with noise and confusion. But <b>Tevar</b> and his team moved slowly, observing first, then approaching.</p>

    <p><i>"We verified the identification and secured the snake using calm, controlled manual restraint with a hook assist. We relocated it to a nearby forest patch where there was suitable habitat and prey. That way, we reduced risk to both the snake and the campus."</i></p>

    <p>To him, rescue work is never about heroics. It is about discipline.</p>

    <h2>A Campus Alive With Movement</h2>

    <p>Snakes are not rare in <b>CMU</b>, and <b>Tevar</b> describes their presence with a steady, matter-of-fact clarity.</p>

    <p><i>"Campus snake density is moderate. They're drawn to rodents, shaded corridors, fallen debris, and the forest patches around campus. Most individuals avoid human areas unless forced into structures by weather or disturbances."</i></p>

    <p>His explanation reframes what many students misinterpret as <i>"infestations."</i> These animals are not invading. They are navigating.</p>

    <h2>The Myths That Endanger Snakes</h2>

    <p>If <b>Tevar</b> could erase one problem entirely, it would be misconceptions.</p>

    <p><i>"People think snakes are evil or that they wait for the right moment to attack. Others believe all snakes are deadly. These ideas are not true."</i></p>

    <p>He has seen how fear escalates a harmless encounter into a dangerous situation. Students corner snakes, throw objects, or attempt to kill them. These actions endanger the animal, and often, the people around it.</p>

    <p>The irony, he points out, is sharp: <i>"Eliminating snakes increases rodent problems and eventually attracts more snakes from outside areas as they follow the food source."</i> Removing snakes does not make anyone safer.</p>

    <h2>Snake Welfare and the Bigger Ecological Picture</h2>

    <p><b>Tevar</b> approaches welfare from both a veterinary and conservation standpoint.</p>

    <p><i>"For the general population, snake welfare starts with stopping the indiscriminate killing. Stress, injury, and unnecessary interference all compromise animal well-being. Correct identification is essential, and relocation should be reserved only for high-risk areas."</i></p>

    <p>One of his most compelling points is the connection between snakes and <b>CMU's</b> celebrated wildlife.</p>

    <p><i>"We share this environment with several Philippine eagles. Snakes form part of their natural prey. Killing snakes disrupts the food chain and harms the survival of our own national bird."</i></p>

    <p>It is a striking reminder: protecting snakes also protects the very species communities rally behind.</p>

    <h2>Coexistence, Distilled to Three Words</h2>

    <p>When asked how the campus community can coexist responsibly with snakes, <b>Tevar</b> gives the simplest answer of all.</p>

    <p><i>"Let them alone. Do not attempt to kill them. If you need them relocated, call us."</i></p>

    <p>Decades of fear crumble into three soft instructions.</p>

    <h2>A University's Role</h2>

    <p><b>Tevar</b> believes universities hold a unique position in shaping responsible wildlife interaction.</p>

    <p>He recommends standardized response protocols, properly trained security staff, reliable communication channels, documentation systems, waste control, vegetation management, and collaboration with experts.</p>

    <p><i>"With the right systems, conservation and campus safety can go hand in hand."</i></p>

    <h2>The Story the Campus Often Misses</h2>

    <p>In the end, the story of <b>CMU's</b> snakes is not about danger. It is about balance. It is about people learning to see movement in the grass not as a threat, but as a sign that the campus remains ecologically alive.</p>

    <p><b>Tevar</b> and his team stand at the intersection of two worlds: the one students walk on every day, and the one quietly unfolding beneath the canopy, between the bamboo, or beneath the sheds. Their work reminds <b>CMU</b> that conservation does not always involve grand gestures. Sometimes, it is as simple as pausing, stepping back, and letting an animal continue on its way.</p>

    <p>The campus breathes with these creatures.</p>

    <p>And through the voices of those who understand them, it finally begins to be heard.</p>
