    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Veterinary internships and clinical rotations expose students to realities far beyond the classroom—moments that challenge, humble, and shape future clinicians. For this feature, we interviewed five veterinary interns and graduates: <b>Jan Vincent Tevar</b>, <b>Kyle Ian Tablon</b>, <b>Dr. Rei Joshua Yasona Ladjahasan</b>, <b>Dr. Joice L. Gallardo</b>, and <b>Doc. Jazmine Endaya</b>.</p>

    <p>Some trained locally, some abroad, but all share experiences that highlight the differences in case exposure, professional culture, caseload, and the emotional weight of practicing veterinary medicine inside—and outside—the <b>Philippines</b>. Each story offers a unique perspective on learning, mistakes, breakthroughs, and the profound responsibility that comes with caring for animals.</p>

    <h2>JAN VINCENT TEVAR – Discipline, Structure, and Situational Awareness</h2>

    <h3>A Foundational First Day</h3>
    <p><b>Jan's</b> rotation at the <b>Veterinary Teaching Hospital</b> began with routine but essential work.</p>

    <p><i>"My first day was spent organizing and cleaning as the facility prepared to become fully operational."</i></p>

    <p>This initial exposure taught him the importance of sanitation, workflow, and setting the tone for disciplined clinical practice.</p>

    <h3>Most Challenging Case</h3>
    <p>He recalls the severe case of a German Shepherd suffering from emaciation and maggot infestation.</p>

    <p><i>"Equipment was incomplete, so we managed the case with resourcefulness and teamwork."</i></p>

    <h3>Mentorship That Shaped Him</h3>
    <p><b>Jan</b> credits <b>Ma'am Jinggay</b>, a microbiology technician, for raising his standards.</p>

    <p><i>"Her professionalism and precision forced me to elevate my own."</i></p>

    <h3>Biggest Lesson</h3>

    <p><i>"The internship made me realize that confidence must always come with caution."</i></p>

    <h2>KYLE IAN TABLON – Life, Death, and the Silent World of Wildlife</h2>

    <h3>A Case That Stretched His Limits</h3>
    <p><b>Kyle</b> faced a life-threatening esophageal obstruction in a snake.</p>

    <p><i>"Without stomach enzymes, the ingested food would rot and lead to sepsis… It needed immediate intervention."</i></p>

    <p>During removal, he discovered a sharp bone fragment that had torn tissue during swallowing.</p>

    <p><i>"The damage required more than a month of recovery."</i></p>

    <h3>A Newfound Respect for Wildlife Medicine</h3>

    <p><i>"Wildlife are voiceless. And yet, they are essential to human survival."</i></p>

    <h3>A Lesson in Safety</h3>
    <p>Snake-handling is unforgiving.</p>

    <p><i>"I've had my share of snakebites… the room for error should be non-existent."</i></p>

    <h3>Advice for Fellow Interns</h3>

    <p><i>"Allow yourself to be a beginner. No expert started with finesse."</i></p>

    <h2>DR. REI JOSHUA YASONA LADJAHASAN – When Reality Collides With Theory</h2>

    <h3>Daily Life Across Rotations</h3>
    <p><b>Dr. Rei's</b> schedule varied widely depending on the facility.</p>

    <p><i>"Some stations felt like we were employed; others felt like an educational field trip."</i></p>

    <h3>A Case That Stayed With Him</h3>
    <p>During a suspected cardiovascular case, a dog crashed during monitoring.</p>

    <p><i>"We tried to revive him, but he didn't make it. Explaining it to the client was the hardest part."</i></p>

    <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>

    <p><i>"Many of my board exam answers came from cases I saw during rotation."</i></p>

    <h3>Teamwork Mindset</h3>

    <p><i>"Veterinary staff are not below the veterinarian—they're workmates."</i></p>

    <h3>Ethical Dilemma</h3>
    <p>One emotionally heavy task involved euthanizing invasive species.</p>

    <p><i>"Hundreds had to be euthanized. It was very hard, but it was above our decision-making."</i></p>

    <h3>Career Direction</h3>
    <p>Marine medicine remains his passion, but life circumstances guided him to a different path.</p>

    <p><i>"Circumstances won over passion."</i></p>

    <h2>DR. JOICE L. GALLARDO – Compassion, Clinical Logic, and the Art of Communication</h2>

    <h3>Typical Routine</h3>
    <p>She assisted with exams, case workups, diagnostics, patient prep, and history taking.</p>

    <p><i>"I assisted in diagnostic procedures and routine patient care."</i></p>

    <h3>Most Challenging Case</h3>
    <p>A dog with a months-long non-healing wound turned out to have Ehrlichiosis and Babesiosis.</p>

    <p><i>"The delayed diagnostics explained the slow healing."</i></p>

    <h3>Core Skills Strengthened</h3>

    <p><i>"History taking, diagnostics, physical exam, and client communication."</i></p>

    <h3>Ethical Insight</h3>

    <p><i>"Euthanasia taught me compassion and responsibility."</i></p>

    <h3>Lesson From a Mistake</h3>

    <p><i>"I once placed an IV catheter too loosely. It taught me the importance of securing equipment properly."</i></p>

    <h3>Career Impact</h3>
    <p>Her exposure solidified her passion for small animal medicine and surgery.</p>

    <h2>DOC. JAZMINE ENDAYA – Real Practice, Ethical Dilemmas, and Finding Confidence</h2>

    <h3>A Day in Her Rotations</h3>
    <p><b>Doc. Jazmine</b> experienced two very different internship structures:</p>

    <p><b>On her first rotation:</b></p>

    <p><i>"My day usually starts with endorsements for confined patients with veterinarians and nurses."</i></p>

    <p><i>"We performed tests as ordered and shadowed consultations when possible."</i></p>

    <p><b>On her second rotation:</b></p>

    <p><i>"We handled the records, patients, and clients by ourselves—but with supervision."</i></p>

    <p><i>"I got to do many clinical procedures with guidance."</i></p>

    <h3>Primary Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Her tasks ranged across diagnostics, patient care, surgery prep, anesthesia monitoring, and client communication.</p>

    <p><i>"I assisted in physical exams, sample collection, restraint, fluid therapy, and even basic surgical tasks."</i></p>

    <h3>Her Most Challenging Case</h3>
    <p>A cat admitted for inappetence turned out to be in obstructed labor—something the owner was unaware of.</p>

    <p><i>"I saw a kitten's head protruding. It was stressful, but I needed to remain calm."</i> Her quick assessment allowed her to call the attending veterinarian and prepare vital history. <i>"Reduced stress and prompt IV access were essential."</i></p>

    <h3>Understanding Veterinary Medicine</h3>

    <p><i>"Real practice is far more complex than textbooks—it demands judgment, empathy, and calm under pressure."</i></p>

    <h3>Skills She Improved Most</h3>

    <p><i>"Communication skills—toward peers, staff, veterinarians, and clients."</i></p>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>

    <p><i>"I learned so much from technicians—practical tips you won't find in books."</i></p>

    <h3>A Difficult Ethical Choice</h3>
    <p>Balancing optimal treatment with financial limitations was one of her toughest calls.</p>

    <p><i>"You advocate for the animal but remain compassionate with the owner."</i></p>

    <h3>Influence on Career Goals</h3>

    <p><i>"It made me certain I want to pursue small animal medicine, especially surgery and internal medicine."</i></p>

    <h3>Notable Mistakes</h3>

    <p><i>"Sometimes I hesitated when I shouldn't have. I learned that confidence must be backed by preparation."</i></p>

    <h3>Emotional Management</h3>

    <p><i>"Having mentors and supportive colleagues helped me cope with tough cases."</i></p>

    <h3>Advanced Opportunities</h3>
    <p>She assisted and observed various surgeries, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>spays and neuters</li>
      <li>enucleation</li>
      <li>laparotomy</li>
      <li>wound repair</li>
      <li>radiograph restraint</li>
      <li>catheter placements</li>
      <li>soft-tissue procedures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mentorship</h3>

    <p><i>"Some corrected me on the spot, others explained afterward. Mentorship made everything easier."</i></p>

    <h3>Communicating With Clients</h3>

    <p><i>"I explained vaccine schedules, medications, and post-op care in simple terms so owners wouldn't feel overwhelmed."</i></p>

    <h3>Balancing Work and Well-Being</h3>

    <p><i>"Rest when you can. Ask for help. Talk to people who care about you."</i></p>

    <h3>Final Advice</h3>

    <p><i>"Be teachable. Ask questions. Take notes. Respect the staff—they'll teach you more than you expect."</i></p>

    <h2>Five Journeys, One Calling, One VetMed</h2>
    <p>Across local facilities and international settings, these five interns discovered the realities of veterinary medicine: discipline, compassion, adaptability, communication, and technical precision. Their stories are reminders that the world of veterinary practice is not just about diagnosing and treating animals—it's about working with people, navigating uncertainty, and learning from every success and mistake.</p>

    <p>Whether in the <b>Philippines</b> or abroad, these experiences have shaped them into more confident, grounded, and capable future veterinarians.</p>
